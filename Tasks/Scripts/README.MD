# Scripts
This folder is meant for scripts that will be executed in Tasks. These scripts help with various functions such as the remove bloat features, and showing cleanup features.


## Name Formatting
All of these scripts have custom name guidelines that must be followed. The names go as followed:

If the script is for debloating, make the prefix **Debloat_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for adding new features, make the prefix **Restore_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for an embedded Tasks feature, make the prefix **Tasks_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for showing any popups or new windows, make the prefix **Prompt_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for any feature not listed, make the prefix **Other_(FileNameHere)**


## File Extension Support
We support the following script languages

- Batch (.bat)

- Powershell (.ps1)

#### Other Languages
We do have plans on supporting other languages to have a more diverse scripting platform, but these will not be added until later because Tasks is 
focused towards computer optimizations, instead of adding scripts.
