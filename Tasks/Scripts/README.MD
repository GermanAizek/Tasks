# Scripts
This folder is meant for scripts that will be executed in Tasks. These scripts help with various functions such as the remove bloat features, and showing cleanup features.


## Name Formatting
All of these scripts have custom name guidelines that must be followed for internal reasons and clarity.

If the script is for debloating, make the prefix **Debloat_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for adding new features, make the prefix **Restore_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for an embedded Tasks feature, make the prefix **Tasks_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for showing any popups or new windows, make the prefix **Prompt_(FileNameHere)**

If the script is for any other feature not listed, make the prefix **Other_(FileNameHere)**


## File Extension Support

- Batch (.bat)
