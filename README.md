- An advanced task manager that gives you more information than the internal Windows Task Manager.
- Remove bloatware from your computer on a click of a button.

# 🦺Prerequisites

To be able to run Tasks, you will need the following:
- [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3005) or higher.


# 🎁Setup

Tasks is a portable program (for now). You can head to the Releases page, choose the latest version, download the zip file (**Note**: Not the Source Code zip file). Extract the zip file, and execute the *.exe* file in the extracted files. You can now experience the program!


# 📐Branch Information

The **master** branch holds the most stable updates for the project, and if you are not looking to the experimental side, or just want to simply use Tasks, then feel free to visit the **master** branch for source code.

The **testing** branch is meant for testing features on the project, and it is not as stable as master. New stuff get added to this branch, but they will not be quite stable and may either work as intended or not.
