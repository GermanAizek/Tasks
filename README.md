**Tasks** is a simple program allowing you to clean your computer, remove bloatware as well as control startup programs, while giving you the experience of the new Advanced Task Manager that works better than Windows Task Manager, faster and lets you control apps that are maliciously eating your system resources.


# ✅Features
- Clean folders such as Prefetch, Downloads, Temp and empty your Recycle Bin easily.
- Enable/Disable Programs that run on Startup.
- An advanced task manager that gives you more information than the internal Windows Task Manager.
- Remove bloatware from your computer on a click of a button.
- Blacklist sites that are known to be malicious / harmful.

# 📩Installation

Pick the stable release or the beta release (which is prone to bugs). ![Latest Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/LiteTools/Tasks?label=latest%20stable) ![Latest Unstable Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/LiteTools/Tasks?include_prereleases&label=latest%20pre-release)

# 📐Branch Information
The **master** branch holds the most stable updates for the project, and if you are not looking to the experimental side, or just want to simply use Tasks, then feel free to visit the **master** branch for source code.

The **testing** branch is meant for testing features on the project, and it is not as stable as master. New stuff get added to this branch, but they will not be quite stable and may either work as intended or not.
