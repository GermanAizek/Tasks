**Tasks** is an application that helps improve computer performance. **Tasks** includes an advanced cleanup tool that deletes junk and temp files from various apps, system temp folders, and unwanted browser extensions. Tasks has a startup manager which lets you manage what programs run on start. Tasks also has a task manager which gives more details than the built in Windows task manager.

### Intentions
We aim to make a lightweight, free, intuitive and responsive cleaning tool. We believe that computer performance is crucial to everyone and should not include any hidden paywalls inside the application. Our goal is to make a tool that anyone can use from anywhere.

## List Of Features
- Advanced Cleanup Tool to help computer performance

- Extension Removal Tool to help remove malicious or unwanted extensions

- Bloatware Removal Tool to help remove bloat on your computer

- Startup Manager to improve system boot times

- Advanced Task Manager to give more details about processes.

## Installation
1. You will need to install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). (If .NET Core is not installed, it will prompt you on opening Tasks.)
2. Download Tasks from the **Releases** tab.
3. Extract the `.zip` and execute the executable `.exe` file. After that, Tasks will launch.

The dependencies must be kept in the same folder, we are working on a fix for this.
