**Tasks** is an application that helps optimize computer performance and efficiency. Tasks includes an advanced cleanup tool that lets you clean application cache files, delete unused browser extensions, clear cookies, and remove bloatware. Tasks also has a startup manager that lets you create, modify, and disable programs that run on startup.

## Installation
Installing Tasks is very simple, as the application is currently portable.
1. Download the stable release from the Releases tab.
2. Extract the .zip, and execute the *.exe* file. After that, Tasks will launch.
Note that the dependencies must be kept in the same folder, and we are working on a fix for that.

### Prerequisites
Before you can run Tasks, you will need to install [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) directly from Microsoft.

## Support The Project
